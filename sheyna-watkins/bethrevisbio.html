      <h2>Ten Things About Beth:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Beth’s favorite TV show is <em>Firefly</em>, followed closely
          by <em>Doctor Who</em>.</li>
        <li>She names her pets after her favorite characters. Her
          current dog is named Sirius, after Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s
          godfather.</li>
        <li>Her favorite color is gray. Boring, but unique.</li>
        <li>Beth is currently in a race with her mother to visit the most
          states and countries. Her mother has 49 states and  Beth only
          has 40, but Beth has 13 countries and her mother only has 8.</li>
        <li>Beth worked as a teacher before she became a writer. She often
          kills off former students in her novels–and they love it.</li>

        <img src="" alt="beth photo2" />

        <li>Beth pretends to know more French than she actually does .</li>
        <li>Beth wrote ten novels before the eleventh novel she wrote sold.
          That novel was <em>Across the Universe</em>. It took her a decade
          and more than a thousand agent rejections before she had any
          success in publishing.</li>
        <li>As a kid, Beth saw the movie <em>Child’s Play</em> much too
          young. She still hates puppets and creepy dolls.</li>
        <li>Remember that old Disney cartoon <em>Gargoyles</em>? Man, that
          was a cool cartoon.</li>
        <li>Still not enough stuff about Beth? <a href="">You can read a
          longer bio here</a>, but it’s pretty boring.</li>
